# **My LeetCode Journey**

Hey there! This repo contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems. I'm not always going for the _most optimal_ approachâ€”instead, I focus on **understanding the problem deeply** and **learning something new** with each solve.

### **How I Approach Problems**

ðŸ”¹ **First Attempt:** I try to solve it my wayâ€”sometimes brute force, sometimes with intuition.  
ðŸ”¹ **Optimization:** After getting it working, I refine the solution (if needed).  
ðŸ”¹ **Key Takeaways:** I note down what I learnedâ€”whether it's a new algorithm, a tricky edge case, or a better way to think about the problem.

### **What Youâ€™ll Find Here**

âœ” **Working solutions** (even if theyâ€™re not the fastest).  
âœ” **Thought process** behind each approach.  
âœ” **Lessons learned**â€”mistakes, optimizations, and "Aha!" moments.

This is my coding diaryâ€”**not perfection, but progress!**
